## A Google Extension that uses Google's AI, Gemini
### It uses a series of prompts to display if the text of a website is trustworthy, taking into account different criteria, which are given a grade from A to C.
### If a website is trustworthy it will be displayed on the extension, with the option to expand on the different criteria.
